### Main program

## Purpose : to simulate 10,000 individuals aged 35 to 95 on the basis of an illness-death model applied to myocardial infarction


# matrice : matrix with 10,000 rows and 4 columns. With individuals in line, age, cohort, age at which individual had a myocardial infarction and age of death in column
# etats :matrix with 10,000 rows and 61 columns. With individuals in rows and ages 35-95 in columns implementing the different states of 0, 1, 2, and 3
# état 0 : living healthy
# état 1 : alive having had a myocardial infarction
# état 2 : dead without having had a heart attack or more than a year after the heart attack
# état 3 : died during the first year after having had a myocardial infarction
# incidence : matrix containing the incidence rates for each age and each cohort
# quotient_morta : matrix containing the mortality quotients for each age and each cohort
# RR1 : relative risk of dying during the first year after having had a myocardial infarction
# RR2 : relative risk of dying more than a year after having had a heart attack


horizon <- 81                                                      # simulation time (between 35 and 115 years = 81 years)
nb_people <- 10000                                                 # size of generated cohorts
